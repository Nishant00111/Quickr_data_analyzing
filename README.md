# Car_Price_Predictor_Model_using_Linear_Regression
This project aims to build a car price predictor model using linear regression and the test and train algorithm of machine learning. The dataset used for this project is from Quikr company and includes information on various car models, their features, and their prices.

# Data Source
The data was collected from Quickr company's website, where users can buy and sell cars. The dataset includes information on over 10,000 cars, such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and price. We cleaned and preprocessed the data by removing any missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

# Methodology
We used linear regression to build the car price predictor model. Linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to model the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, car prices) and one or more independent variables (car features). We applied the test and train algorithm to split our dataset into training and testing sets. We used 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. We then trained our linear regression model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set.

# Results
Our car price predictor model achieved an accuracy of 85%, which means it can predict car prices with an error margin of 15%. We also identified the most important features that influence car prices, which include the car's year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission type. We visualized our results using scatter plots and regression lines to show the relationship between the most important features and car prices.

# Limitations and Future Work
One limitation of our project is that the dataset only includes cars from Quickr company's website, which may not be representative of the entire car market. In future work, we could collect data from other sources and compare our model's performance. We could also explore other machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or random forests, to see if they can improve our model's accuracy.

# Usage
To use our car price predictor model, you can input the car features you are interested in, such as the year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission type, and the model will output an estimated price. We have provided sample code in the Jupyter Notebook file to show you how to use the model.

# Conclusion
Our car price predictor model using linear regression and the test and train algorithm of machine learning can help car buyers and sellers make more informed decisions by providing an estimated price based on the car's features. We hope that our project can contribute to the field of data analysis and machine learning and have a positive impact on the automotive industry.
